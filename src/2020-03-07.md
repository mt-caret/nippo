Today, I started Duolingo. I created a quick script to get the link to a
pronounciation audio file on Wiktionary so I can import it into Anki.

<figure class="fullwidth">
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

curl \
  -X GET "https://en.wiktionary.org/api/rest_v1/page/media/$1" \
  -H  "accept: application/json; charset=utf-8; profile="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Specs/Media/1.3.1"" |
jq '
  .items |
  map(select(.type == "audio")) |
  map({ source: .original.source, description: .description.text }) |
  .[]'
```
</figure>

Holy shit this was an amazing talk:
