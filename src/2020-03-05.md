I was at Hakone for the past few days.

Just watched Vice, a movie about the career of Dick Cheney, and learnt a whole lot
about American politics a decade ago which set the stage for the current
political landscape.

Some related articles:

- [“Vice” vs. the Real Dick Cheney | The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/vice-vs-the-real-dick-cheney)
- [Torture Memos - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture_Memos#March_14,_2003,_Memo_from_John_Yoo_to_DOD_re:_Interrogation_methods_overseas)

Also rewatched Risk by Laura Poitras. I haven't been keeping an eye on the
security/privacy community for a while. Maybe it's time to start.
