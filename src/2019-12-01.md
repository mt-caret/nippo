title: log 2019-12-01

<section>
A while back, I used to keep a daily log of things I did here. After some
thought, I decided to stop doing this and removed everything, but after some
more thought, I'm deciding to revive the log to a lesser extent and only jot
down technically interesting material.[^lang]

[^lang]:
	In English.

To start thing off, I'm going to try to write something every day here this
month, and record it here: [mt\_nippo Advent Calendar 2019 - Adventar](https://adventar.org/calendars/4641)

I've tried going with minimalist styling that last time, so I'm experimenting
with something new this time: [Tufte CSS](https://github.com/jez/tufte-pandoc-css)
