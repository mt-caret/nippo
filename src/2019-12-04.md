I was going to write a part 2, continuing on from last time, but after reading
through some stuff on the topic, I've realized that writing it would take much
more time than a day, so I'm leaving that to another time. Meanwhile, I'll just
list resources that I've read which were particularly interesting and informative.

In no particular order:
