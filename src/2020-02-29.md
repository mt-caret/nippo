Yesterday, I read a book titled 「上野先生、フェミニズムについてゼロから教えてください! 」.
I bought the book expecting an introduction to feminism, but it was more like a
historical account of feminism in Japan and how it had changed over the
generations, mixed with discussions of miscellaneous issues like parenting.
The book was thin enough to be finished in a few hours, and while the title
felt a bit misleading, there were enough interesting ideas so I think it was
well worth the read.

## spaced repitition

My goal this year is self-improvement, and my short-to-medium term goal
is studying various topics including a small portion of undergraduate-level math.
As such, I'm re-reading a number of self-improvement books for some meta-learning
so I can study more efficiently, and one topic that keeps coming up is
spaced repitition.

I'm going to try and have another go at integrating Anki into my life,
based on the stuff written by [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition),
[Nielsen](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html), and Nishio[^nishio].

[^nishio]: 「エンジニアの知的生産術」. I think the stuff written here is
fairly valuable and Japanese software engineers who haven't at least taken
a look at the ideas covered here are missing out quite a bit.

Wow, the more I learn about spaced repitition the more it seems to good to be true: [Random Observations: Teaching linear algebra](https://www.gwern.net/docs/www/bentilly.blogspot.com/bf5845a44010c266a9658ab9f915a6b62ccf97dc.html)

I like [this](https://www.gwern.net/docs/cs/1982-perlis.pdf):

<div class="epigraph">
> 33\. The 11th commandment was "Thou Shalt Compute" or "Thou Shalt Not Compute" -- I forget which.
